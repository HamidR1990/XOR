# XOR Problem


##### This is python code for the XOR problem. In this code, through functional programming we design a two-layer neural network to solve this classic problem in A.I.




#### The main object of this project is to write a nonlinear regression algorithm without using usual libraries, in particular, scikit-learn and other prepared tools.
